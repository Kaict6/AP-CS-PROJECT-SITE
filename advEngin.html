  <h2>Fusion 360 Tutorial Parts</h2>
  <p>By watching the Fusion 360 basic tutorials, I was able to create these 3D models that I am able to 3D print. It was pretty interesting making these models as I had to problem solve why some of my pieces weren't shaped competely. Overall it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed making them.</p>

      <h2>Cardboard Bridge Ver. 1.0</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSiboZyNT4k">Bridge Video Test</a></p>
      <p>In groups of 4, our Advanced Engineering class was tasked to create a cardboard bridge design on AutoCAD, and test how much weight our bridge could hold. This project was interesting as I was exposed to many aspects of engineering that I had no knowledge of beforehand, such as using AutoCAD and laser cutting, which we used to cut out our bridge design. The image on the left shows our finished bridge design, and the image on the right shows our bridge after the weight test and where it collapsed. We designed the pieces to interlock by creating slots in the top and bottom sections, where pegs from the side sections fit in. This arrangement places more vertical stress on the side pieces, which theoretically makes them stronger compared to having stress on the horizontally-oriented top and bottom sections and their joints.</p>

      <p>Constraints:
      Max Length: 400mm.
      Max Span: 300mm.
      Width: Must be wide enough for two (toy) cars</p>

     <p>Our data:
      82g bridge weight.
      32.5 lbs = 14.74kg supported.
      Slightly too skinny.
      0.18kg supported / g of bridge = 180X efficiency rating.</p>

      <p>What didn't work: Our bridge was loosely assembled and lacked sufficient internal support. As a result, it quickly changed from a rectangular shape to a trapezoid shape, with the main failure point occurring on the right side during testing.</p>
    
      <p>What can we improve: We need to strengthen the connections between the sides and the top/bottom pieces and add internal supports to reduce shifting. Additionally, we should create a more precise connection between the crutch pieces underneath the bridge and the rest of the structure to ensure better alignment. Adding more tabs to connect the sides to the top/bottom and making the bridge wider to meet the requirements will also help.</p>
